rg uses rust based regex but doesnt support full pcre
https://regex101.com/r/nI8xB8/1
-U or --multiline flag
580  rg '\w+/' /var/log/kibana/kibana.log
  581  rg '\w+/g' /var/log/kibana/kibana.log
  582  rg '\w+' /var/log/kibana/kibana.log
  583  rg '\w+\n' /var/log/kibana/kibana.log
  584  rg --U '\w+\n' /var/log/kibana/kibana.log
  585  rg --U 'executable' /var/log/kibana/kiban


look into pcregrep which supports full pcre based regex
sudo apt install pcregrep        # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install pcre-tools      # Fedora/RHEL
brew install pcre                # macOS

pcregrep '(?<=foo)bar' file.txt         # Positive lookbehind
pcregrep '(\w+)\s+\1' file.txt          # Backreference to repeated word


What type of regex does Elasticsearch use in its ingest pipelines (e.g., with grok, script, etc.)?
✅ Short Answer:
Elasticsearch primarily uses Java-based regular expressions, specifically the flavor supported by the Java Pattern API — which is similar to PCRE, but not identical.
🔍 Where regex is used in Elasticsearch:
1. Grok processor (Ingest pipelines)
Grok is built on regex.
Uses named regex patterns like %{IP}, %{WORD}, etc.
Internally, it's compiled into Java regex.
You can define custom patterns or use raw regex inside grok patterns.
{
  "grok": {
    "field": "message",
    "patterns": ["%{COMMONAPACHELOG}"]
  }
}


2. Script processor (painless)
You can use regex with the Pattern class inside a painless script.
{
  "script": {
    "source": """
      if (ctx.message != null && ctx.message =~ /error.*/) {
        ctx.level = 'error';
      }
    """
  }
}
✅ Uses Java regex engine under the hood.
3. Regex-based filters in queries or mappings
e.g., regexp query, pattern in mappings, etc.
{
  "regexp": {
    "username": "admin[0-9]+"
  }
}
Again: This is Java regex, not full PCRE. It supports things like:
Character classes ([a-z])
Quantifiers (*, +, {n,m})
Anchors (^, $)
Alternation (|)
Grouping ((pattern))
❌ No support for:
Lookaheads ((?=...))
Lookbehinds ((?<=...))
Backreferences (\1, \k<name>)
🚫 What You Don’t Get:

Feature	Supported in Elasticsearch?
Lookahead	❌ No
Lookbehind	❌ No
Backreferences	❌ No
Named capture groups	❌ No (except via grok's named fields)
🧠 TL;DR:

Area	Regex Type
Grok	Java regex (via grok patterns)
Script processor	Java regex (via Painless)
Regexp query	Java regex

So: Elasticsearch uses Java-style regex, which is powerful but not quite full PCRE.
Let me know if you want help crafting a regex for Elasticsearch — grok patterns especially can be a bit tricky!




what about Logstash what regex that uses?
ChatGPT said:
Ah, now we’re getting into the Logstash side of the ELK stack — nice!
🧠 So, what kind of regex does Logstash use?
✅ Short Answer:
**Logstash uses Java-style regular expressions, just like Elasticsearch — because it runs on the JVM and uses the same underlying Java regex engine.
But it gets even more powerful when you use Grok filters, which are basically named regex patterns built on top of Java regex.
🧩 Breakdown:
1. grok filter plugin (most common regex use in Logstash)
Grok is built entirely on Java regex.
Provides a readable DSL of named patterns like %{IP}, %{DATA}, %{WORD}, etc.
You can also define custom regex patterns.
filter {
  grok {
    match => { "message" => "%{IP:client} %{WORD:method} %{URIPATHPARAM:request}" }
  }
}
Under the hood, the %{IP} expands into a Java regex like:
(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)(?:\.|$)){4}
✅ So you're really using Java regex — just made friendlier via Grok.
2. regexp in conditionals
You can use raw regex in conditionals too:
if [message] =~ /ERROR.*/ {
  mutate { add_field => { "level" => "error" } }
}
✅ Again: This is Java regex, so:
Character classes, groups, quantifiers — ✅
Backreferences (\1) — ✅
Lookaheads ((?=...)) — ✅
Lookbehinds ((?<=...)) — ✅
🚨 BUT: Whether lookbehind is supported depends on the exact Java version running Logstash. Older versions didn’t always handle complex lookbehinds well.
3. mutate, gsub, and other filters
These support regex in substitution too:
mutate {
  gsub => [ "message", "\s+", " " ]
}
Again — Java regex flavor.
✅ Summary: What Regex Does Logstash Use?

Feature	Supported?
Character classes	✅ Yes
Groups & alternation	✅ Yes
Quantifiers (+, *)	✅ Yes
Lookaheads	✅ Yes
Lookbehinds	✅ Yes (Java >= 9+, depending on complexity)
Backreferences	✅ Yes
Named groups	❌ Not in raw regex, but grok offers named fields
🔧 TL;DR:
Logstash uses Java regular expressions across its filters, especially:
grok (built on regex)
regexp in conditionals
gsub in mutate filters
💡 If you're using grok, you're working with friendly regex abstractions that expand into gnarly Java regex behind the scenes.



what type of regex grep uses
ChatGPT said:
Great question! Let's break down what type of regex grep uses and what flavors it supports:
✅ grep (Basic and Extended Regex)
1. Basic Regular Expressions (BRE) — Default mode
This is the default regex type that grep uses when no extra flags are specified.
Supported features:
Basic pattern matching
Meta-characters like ., *, [], etc.
But, no support for extended features like +, ?, or {} unless you use grep -E.
Key differences in BRE:
* means "zero or more occurrences" of the previous character or group (just like in other regex flavors).
To use special characters like +, ?, {}, you must escape them with a backslash (\).
Example (Basic Regex):
grep 'a.*b' file.txt    # Matches any string with "a" followed by "b"
But if you wanted to match one or more occurrences, you need to escape the + in BRE:
grep 'a\+b' file.txt    # Match "a+b" as literal text (not "a followed by one or more b's")
2. Extended Regular Expressions (ERE) — with grep -E or egrep
When you use grep -E or egrep, grep switches to Extended Regular Expressions. This makes things easier and more intuitive compared to BRE because you don’t need to escape certain special characters like +, ?, or {}.
Supported features:
Supports more expressive constructs like:
+ (one or more)
? (zero or one)
{n,m} (between n and m occurrences)
| (alternation)
() (grouping)
Example (Extended Regex):
grep -E 'a+b' file.txt   # Matches "a" followed by one or more "b"s
3. Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) — with grep -P
When using grep -P, grep switches to Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE). However, this is not available on all systems unless you've installed a version of grep that supports PCRE (like GNU grep with libpcre).
Supported features:
Full support for advanced features:
Lookaheads and lookbehinds ((?=...), (?<=...))
Non-greedy quantifiers (*?, +?)
Backreferences (\1, \2, etc.)
Named groups ((?<name>...))
And much more!
Example (PCRE):
grep -P '(?<=foo)bar' file.txt  # Positive lookbehind to match "bar" preceded by "foo"
⚠️ Important to Note:
grep by default uses Basic Regex (BRE) unless you specify Extended Regex (ERE) with -E or PCRE with -P.
grep -P (PCRE) isn't universally available — not all systems compile grep with PCRE support, especially on macOS.
grep has limitations when compared to PCRE in terms of advanced features like backreferences and lookbehinds, but grep -E offers a good balance of functionality for most cases.
✅ TL;DR:
Basic Regex (BRE): Default for grep, uses standard regex but needs escaping for certain features (e.g., +, ?, {}).
Extended Regex (ERE): With grep -E or egrep, supports advanced features like +, ?, {} without escaping.
PCRE (Perl-Compatible Regex): With grep -P, offers the full regex power (lookaheads, lookbehinds, non-greedy matches, etc.), but may not be available by default on all systems.
If you need help translating a regex pattern to work with grep, just drop it here! 😄
